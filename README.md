# Jupyter Notebooks 101

An introduction to Jupyter Notebooks.

## Session description

Jupyter Notebooks are a popular interactive computing environment in teaching and research. The sprawling landscape of Jupyter can be confusing, however, and many of the features and pitfalls of running your code in a Jupyter notebook are rarely highlighted. This session will therefore focus on Jupyter Notebooks themselves. We will discuss and demonstrate various flavors of Jupyter Notebooks, showcase a selection of their most helpful features, and even write some magic code.

This session does not require any prior knowledge. It can serve as a helpful prerequisite for many of the more coding-focused sessions offered this term that use Jupyter Notebooks.
